# How to help graders find your codes correctly and quickly


For your code in each question, you can either directly cite them in your README.md by using code blocks like this (Note: They still should be included as files in your assignment repository):

```python
import numpy as np

print('This is a code block for question 1')
```

Or use hyperlink to make sure us can open the right file. Like this: Codes for question 1 [q1a.py](https://github.com/lsc4ss-a21/assignment-1-jinfei1125/blob/main/q1a.py) and [q1b.py](https://github.com/lsc4ss-a21/assignment-1-jinfei1125/blob/main/q1b.py).

Note you will only know the link of the files in the repository after you pushed/uploaded them. So this means you would need to update your README.md after you pushed all the codes to your repository. Though, the format of url is always `https://github.com/lsc4ss-a21/repository name/blob/main/filename`. 

Here is a tutorial on how to create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links) and [code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) in a markdown file. 

While I agree that naming a file in an comprehensive way is a good habit, to make it grader-friendly, just name your file in a short and simple way, like `q1.py`,`q1_plot.py`, `q2.py`, etc. We would really appreciate that!
