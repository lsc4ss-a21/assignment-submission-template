# Question 1

For your code in question 1, you can either directly include them in your markdown file by using code blocks like this:

``` 
import numpy as np

print('This is a code block for question 1')
```

Or use hyperlink to make sure us can open the right file. Like this: Codes for question 1 [q1a.py](https://github.com/lsc4ss-a21/assignment-1-jinfei1125/blob/main/q1a.py) and [q1b.py](https://github.com/lsc4ss-a21/assignment-1-jinfei1125/blob/main/q1b.py). Note you will only know the link of the files in the repository after you pushed/uploaded them. So this means you would need to update your README.md after you pushed all the codes to your repository. Though, the format of url is always `https://github.com/lsc4ss-a21/repository name/blob/main/filename`. 

Here is a tutorial on how to create [links](code blocks) and [code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) in a markdown file. 

While I agree that naming a file in an comprehensive way is a good habit, to make it grader-friendly, just name your file in a short and simple way, like `q1.py`,`q1_plot.py`, `q2.py`, etc. We would really appreciate that!
